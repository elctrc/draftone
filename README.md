# draftone
A way towards a first draft

## what is this
draftone is a ridiculously simple "text writer" that allows you to write text,
one line at a time without the emotional barrier of seeing what you just wrote.

In other words, the moment you write a line or sentence and hit Enter, it
vanishes from the screen, freeing your mind to write the next. And the next...
And the next...

The goal is to stop fretting and re-reading your last paragraph but to plow
ahead just to get that first draft done.

## getting started
Here's what you'll need to know to get writin'

### prerequisites
You'll need to be on Python 3+. Otherwise, all modules are base Python.

### installing
Just drop draftone.py anywhere

## how to use
To run the program:
```bash
python draftone.py new_document.txt
```

Where "new_story.txt" is either a new filename for your document or one that
already exists (the program will not overwrite but will append to it).

Now get writing!
